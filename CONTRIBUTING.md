## How to Pull Request

Here's how to contribute a pull request:

1. **Fork the repository**: If you don't already have a copy of the project on your own GitHub account, you'll need to fork the repository to create one. To do this, click the "Fork" button in the top-right corner of the repository page on GitHub. This will create a copy of the repository on your own account.
2. **Clone the repository**: Once you have a copy of the repository on your own account, you'll need to clone it to your local machine. To do this, open a terminal and navigate to the directory where you want to store the project. Then run the following command, replacing [YOUR_USERNAME] with your GitHub username and [YOUR_REPOSITORY] with the name of the repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/[YOUR_USERNAME]/[YOUR_REPOSITORY].git
```

3. **Create a new branch**: Before you start making changes to the code, it's a good idea to create a new branch. This allows you to work on your changes without affecting the main branch of the repository. To create a new branch, run the following command:

```sh
git checkout -b [BRANCH_NAME]
```

Replace [BRANCH_NAME] with a descriptive name for your branch, such as "fix-typo" or "add-feature".

4. **Make your changes**: Now you can start making the changes you want to contribute to the project. Make sure to test your changes thoroughly to ensure that they work as intended.
5. Commit your changes: When you're satisfied with your changes, you'll need to commit them to your local repository. To do this, run the following command

```sh
git commit -am "[COMMIT_MESSAGE]"
```

Replace [COMMIT_MESSAGE] with a brief description of your changes.

6. Push your changes to GitHub: Now that your changes are committed to your local repository, you'll need to push them to your fork on GitHub. To do this, run the following command:

```sh
git push origin [BRANCH_NAME]
```

7. **Submit a pull request**: Once your changes are pushed to your fork on GitHub, you can submit a pull request to the project maintainers. To do this, go to the repository page on GitHub and click the "Compare & pull request" button. This will open a form where you can write a brief description of your changes and submit the pull request for review.
